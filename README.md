# dotfiles

This is the home of Mike Richman's dotfiles.

In my work and play to-date, I've tried or looked into a few schemes for
managing my configurations.  Since late 2019, I've been maintaining this
repository with a custom [install.py].  It gets the job done.


# other attempts

* rsync.  Yeah, just... copy working configurations wherever they need to be.
  Not great.

* [vcsh].  Either this was too heavy, or I wasn't ready for it when I tried it,
  or both.

* rsync again.

* [thoughtbot dotfiles].  I haven't actually tried this, but looking over it a
  bit was enough to convince me that plain-old github is enough to do the job.

* [chezmoi].  Haven't tried it yet, but if I ever do move on from my custom
  install script, this is probably where I'll go next.
