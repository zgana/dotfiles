# dotfiles

This is the (new) home of Mike Richman's dotfiles.

In my work and play to-date, I've tried or looked into a few schemes for
managing my configurations.  I've gotten by.  After some adventures
switching to emacs[spacemacs] and back to vim, it seems high time I get all
this organized.


# other attempts

* rsync.  Yeah, just... copy working configurations wherever they need to
  be.  Not great.

* vcsh (https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh).  Either this was too heavy, or I
  wasn't ready for it when I tried it, or both.

* rsync again.

* thoughtbot dotfiles (https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).  I haven't
  actually tried this, but looking over it a bit was enough to convince me
  that plain-old github is enough to do the job.
